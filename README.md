# Exercise Tracker and Visualizer

I will be developing software that records progress in
exercises put in by the user.
The software would give insight to the user about the
progress that they are making. For example, percentage
increase in weight or volume.

Keeping track of your progress is an important aspect of exercising and the 
mobile software available for this is often paid.
