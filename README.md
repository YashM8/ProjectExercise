# Exercise Tracker and Visualizer

I will be developing software that records progress in 
exercises selected by the user.
The software would give insight to the user about the
progress that they are making. For example, percentage
increase in weight or volume.

## User Stories -

- As a user, I want to be able to add an exercise with a specific number of sets and repetitions.
- As a user, I want to be able to add exercises into a routine.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my progress in each exercise graphically and numerically.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit an exercise or routine.
