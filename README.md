# Exercise Tracker

I will be developing software that records progress in
exercises put in by the user.
The software would give insight to the user about the
progress that they are making. For example, percentage
increase in weight or volume.

Keeping track of your progress is an important aspect of exercising and the 
mobile software available for this is often paid.

## Phase 4: Task 3 - 

- I would create the choice to have multiple users.


- I would split my GUI class into subclasses to make debugging easier.


- I would have single point of control for my setBounds() method to have everything displayed proportionally in the GUI 
without having to put in a carefully calculated numbers for each component.
